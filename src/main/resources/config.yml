# You can add new worlds by simple following the schema below

    generate-portal-room: false # when this is set to true the portal room which leads to the end
      # will get generated even, if the portal room is in an empty chunk
      # in which case the portal room will fly mid air
      # This option only works for worlds, which have normally a portal room (normally only the overworld)
    affect-spawn-chunks: true # normally the plugin does not affect spawn chunks, however with this method set to true,
      # the plugin will attempt to also affect those chunks. The methode which is used to achieve
      # this is not 100% save and can lead to server errors on startup

      # This option only works for worlds, which have the exit portal (normally only the end world)
    fallback-exit-portal-height: 64
    generate-end-spike: true # With this set to true the plugin will generated the end spikes (Obsidian pillars in the end with
      # the end cristal on top), regardless if the chunk is removed or not.

    chunk-validator:
      name: "checkerboard" # generateds a checkerboard stile world
