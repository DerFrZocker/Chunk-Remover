# You can add new worlds by simple following the schema below
world-datas:

    generate-portal-room: false # when this is set to true the portal room which leads to the end
                                # will get generated even, if the portal room is in an empty chunk
                                # in which case the portal room will fly mid air
                                #
                                # This option only works for worlds, which have normally a portal room (normally only the overworld)

      data:
        name-seeded: true # true: the resulting pattern is dependent on the world seed and name

        chance: 70.0 # The chance that a chunk is an empty chunk from 0 (no chunk gets removed) to 100 (all chunks are getting removed)
                     # In this case 70% of the world is removed
  dummy-world-2:
    fix-exit-portal: true # If set to true, the plugin will attempt to fix the exit portal
                          # For this it uses the surrounding terrain, if no surrounding terrain is found
                          # the value from fallback-exit-portal-height is used
                          # If this is set to false, there is a change that you can not ender the exit portal
                          #
                          # This option only works for worlds, which have the exit portal (normally only the end world)
